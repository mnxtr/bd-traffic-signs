- Created BRSDD dataset (8,953 images, 29 classes)
- Trained and compared YOLOv11-Nano vs SSD-MobileNet
- Deployed production applications (Android + Web)

**Results:**
- YOLOv11 achieves 99.45% mAP@50 (superior to SSD's ~88%)
- Real-time CPU inference: 22.2 FPS
- Ultra-compact: 5.2 MB model (74% smaller than SSD)
- Ranks among top state-of-the-art systems

**Impact:**
- Enables affordable ADAS for Bangladesh
- Foundation for autonomous vehicle research
- Addresses road safety crisis
- Open-source contribution
