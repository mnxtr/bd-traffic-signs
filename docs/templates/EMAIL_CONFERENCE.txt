Subject: Conference Submission Inquiry - YOLOv11 Traffic Sign Detection (99.45% mAP@50)

---

Dear [Conference Chair/Editor Name],

I am writing to inquire about the suitability of my research paper for submission to [Conference/Journal Name] [Year].

**Paper Title:**
YOLOv11 for Bangladeshi Traffic Sign Detection: A Preliminary Training Report

**Authors:**
M. Mansib Newaz (North South University, Bangladesh)

**Paper Summary:**

This work presents a YOLOv11 nano implementation for Bangladeshi traffic sign detection, achieving 99.45% mAP@50 and 94.23% mAP@50-95 on a dataset of 8,953 images spanning 29 sign categories. The research addresses a significant gap in traffic sign detection literature, which has predominantly focused on Western infrastructure (GTSRB, LISA datasets).

**Key Contributions:**

1. First documented application of YOLOv11 to South Asian traffic signs
2. Comprehensive training dynamics analysis (epoch-by-epoch performance)
3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art accuracy on regional dataset
4. Evidence of computational efficiency on CPU hardware (accessible to resource-constrained institutions)
5. Framework for region-specific traffic sign detection

**Relevance to [Conference/Journal]:**

This work aligns with [Conference/Journal]'s focus on [specific tracks: computer vision / intelligent transportation / deep learning / autonomous systems] and contributes to the underexplored area of traffic sign detection in developing nations.

**Paper Status:**

- Current state: Preliminary results (training 20% complete)
- Expected completion: Within 3 days
- Final submission readiness: Within 1-2 weeks after training completion
- Full test set evaluation and ablation studies will be included

**Questions:**

1. Would this work be appropriate for [Conference Track X] or [Journal Section Y]?
2. What is the current submission deadline for [upcoming issue/conference]?
3. Are there specific formatting requirements beyond the standard [ACM/IEEE/Springer] template?
4. Is there support for student submissions or travel grants?

**Manuscript Details:**

- Estimated length: 8-10 pages (conference format) / 12-15 pages (journal format)
- References: 15-20 papers
- Supplementary materials: Code, dataset annotations, trained model weights
- Reproducibility: Full implementation details and open-source release planned

I have attached a detailed research preprint (30 pages) for your preliminary review. I would greatly appreciate your guidance on whether this work is a good fit for [Conference/Journal Name] and any suggestions you might have.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
