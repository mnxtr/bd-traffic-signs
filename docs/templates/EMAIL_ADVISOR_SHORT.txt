Subject: Request for Feedback - YOLOv11 Traffic Sign Detection Research (Preliminary Results)

---

Dear Professor [Name],

I am Mohammad Mansib Newaz, a [year] student in the Department of Computer Science at North South University. I am reaching out to share preliminary results from my research on Bangladeshi traffic sign detection and to seek your valuable feedback.

**Research Summary:**

Using YOLOv11 nano architecture, I have trained a model on 8,953 Bangladeshi traffic sign images (29 categories) that has achieved 99.45% mAP@50 after only 10 of 50 training epochs. This performance is competitive with state-of-the-art results on international benchmarks (GTSRB), despite our regional dataset being significantly smaller.

**Why This Matters:**

Existing traffic sign detection research focuses predominantly on Western infrastructure. Bangladesh's unique signage (including Bengali text, mosque indicators, and region-specific symbols) requires localized solutions for autonomous vehicle systems and intelligent transportation development.

**Request:**

I would be honored if you could review the attached research preprint (30 pages) and provide feedback on:
1. The methodology and experimental approach
2. Statistical significance of the results
3. Suggested publication venues
4. Potential improvements or additional analyses

I am particularly interested in your perspective on [specific aspect related to their expertise].

**Availability:**

I am available for a meeting at your convenience, either in person or via Zoom, to discuss this research in greater detail.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your guidance.

Respectfully,
