<5%)
   - Underrepresentation of rare signs (animal_crossing: 123 instances)
   - Geographic bias toward major cities (Dhaka 45%, Chittagong 25%)
   - Annotation errors: Estimated 5-10 instances with incorrect labels

2. **Model Limitations:**
   - Small object detection: Performance drops for signs <32×32 pixels
   - Heavy occlusion: Struggles with >50% occlusion
   - Similar sign confusion: speed_limit_40 vs speed_limit_60 (similar appearance)
   - Real-time constraint: Trade-off with accuracy (nano variant used)

3. **Evaluation Limitations:**
   - Single test set (no cross-validation due to computational cost)
   - Limited real-world testing (simulated scenarios)
   - CPU-only benchmarking (GPU speeds estimated)
   - No long-term deployment monitoring

4. **Deployment Limitations:**
   - Android app: Requires API 24+ (Android 7.0), excludes older devices
   - Model quantization: INT8 introduces minor accuracy loss (~0.5% mAP)
   - Network dependency: Web demo requires internet
   - Scalability: Single-server deployment, no load balancing

| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| animal_crossing | 123 | 94.2% | 48.1% | 92.5% | 91.8% | 92.1% |
| **Mean** | **443.7** | **99.45%** | **54.52%** | **98.7%** | **97.8%** | **98.2%** |

**Inference Speed by Batch Size (CPU):**

| Batch Size | Images/Second | ms/Image | Memory (MB) |
|------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 22.2 | 45.0 | 250 |
| 4 | 18.5 | 54.1 | 520 |
| 8 | 15.3 | 65.4 | 890 |
| 16 | 12.1 | 82.6 | 1650 |

Recommendation: Batch size 1 for real-time applications

**Failure Case Analysis:**

**Category 1: Small Distant Signs (<32px)**
- Detection rate: 67.3%
- Main issue: Insufficient resolution after pooling
- Solution: Multi-scale training, larger input size

**Category 2: Heavy Occlusion (>50%)**
- Detection rate: 54.2%
- Main issue: Incomplete sign features
- Solution: Temporal tracking, ensemble methods

**Category 3: Extreme Weather (Heavy rain, fog)**
- Detection rate: 71.8%
- Main issue: Low contrast, blur
- Solution: Enhanced augmentation, pre-processing

**Category 4: Similar Sign Confusion**
- speed_limit_40 ↔ speed_limit_60: 3.2% confusion rate
- no_left_turn ↔ no_right_turn: 2.8% confusion rate
- Solution: Attention mechanisms, higher resolution
